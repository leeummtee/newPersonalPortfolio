      <h3> objective </h3>
      <p>
        Project for a Design Communication and Collaboration class. Students were given a two-week timeframe to design posters for SIAT advisors to use when welcoming SIAT freshmen.

      <h3> programs used </h3>
      <p>
        Adobe Illustrator

      <h3> a. sketches </h3>
      <p>
        My design process started out with multiple ideation sketches for a large banner-style poster with tips on getting started with Discord. Since we were required by the teaching staff to incorporate signs and symbols, I wanted to make a design
        with the Discord logo wearing a cape to symbolize it as a powerful tool for working on online group projects.
      </p>
    </div>

      <img class="almost-full-width-img" src="compressed-images/poster-sketches-desktop.png" alt="logo and poster ideation sketches" id=poster-sketches>
    </div>

    <!-- type 3 -->
    <div class="block-detailed">
      <h3> b. initial render </h3>
      <p>
        Using my sketches as reference, I started creating my first mock-up in Adobe Illustrator.
        Seeing things in a higher fidelity made me realize that Discord's name needed to stand out more, so I also ended up placing its name on a shooting star to symbolize how it can be the answer to students’ wishes for an easier way to communicate
        on projects online.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- type 4 -->
    <div class="block-detailed" data-aos-duration="1000" data-aos="fade-up">
      <img class="almost-full-width-img" src="compressed-images/illustrator-1.jpg" alt="initial illustrator render">

    <div class="block-detailed">
      <h3> c. outcome </h3>
      <p>
        My initial feedback from my peers was that a banner-style poster with so much information would be overwhelming for students to look at. Based on their critiques, I decided to shrink it down to an A0 size by cutting out the steps and
        replacing it with a summary of Discord’s features.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- type 6 -->
    <div class="block-detailed" data-aos-duration="1000" data-aos="fade-up">
      <img class="almost-full-width-img" src="compressed-images/poster-outcome.png" alt="final poster & render" id=poster-outcome>
    </div>

    <!-- type 7 -->
    <div class="block-detailed" id="reflection-poster">
      <h2 class="divider left-aligned"> 03. reflection </h2>
      <p>
        Working on this project made me realize how important it is for a poster to able to get a lot of information across with just a quick glance. My first design had too much content and would require a passerby to thoroughly read through all of
        it to get the full meaning behind the poster. However, I feel that the changes I made allowed for a much clearer message to be communicated in a much quicker way.
