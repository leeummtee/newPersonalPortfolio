        These videos were made for a New Media Images class. For the special effects assignment, students were given a one-week timeframe to implement at least two kinds of visual effects in a short video. For the  final project, students were given different options for the video and had three weeks to complete it. I chose to do a found-footage trailer.
      </p>

      <!-- <h3> idea </h3>
      <p>
        I wanted to make an engaging edit for the special effects video, so I decided to make one using glowing-line effects like that ones that have become popular on social media. I ended up making the theme about basketball since it is a sport I have always been into. As a result, I also ended up making the trailer video about the Toronto Raptors - my favourite team.

      <h3> a. effects video </h3>
      <p>
        I wanted to make the theme about basketball since I have always been into the sport, so the base footage is a clip I filmed of a friend dribbling a ball and taking a shot. In terms of the effects, I wanted to make it as engaging as possible so I decided to make one using glowing-line effects like that ones that have become popular on social media. The other two effects that I incorporated are a screen replacement and an explosion effect. These were all done in After Effects and Premier Pro.

      <h3> b. found-footage trailer </h3>
      <p>
        I decided to make my trailer about the Toronto Raptors since they are my favourite basketball team. I wanted the video to showcase their run during the 2018-2019 season, from the regular season to the NBA finals. To do so, I found several clips on YouTube and edited them all together in Premier Pro.

      <h2 class="divider left-aligned"> 03. reflection </h2>
      <p>
        The effects project was a fun opportunity for me to learn more about After Effects and how to bring videos to life through creativity. I especially enjoyed the trailer project, as I really loved being able to make a video about a topic and team that I am passionate about. My efforts for both projects were rewarded as I received full marks on the effects video, and nominations for best sound design and best found-footage trailer for my Toronto Raptors video.
