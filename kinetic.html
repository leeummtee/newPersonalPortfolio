        Final project for a Digital Image Design class. Students were given a three-week timeframe to communicate motion through kinetic typography based on a clip of dialogue.

        Adobe Illustrator, Adobe After Effects, Adobe Photoshop

      <h3> a. ideation </h3>
      <p>
        I decided to make my work based on Muhammad Ali's iconic "I'll show you how great I am" speech. Since he spoke very boldly and with a lot of energy, I felt that it would make for a powerful and engaging motion graphic. To match his bold claims and persona I chose to use Century Gothic and 28 Days Later as my two typefaces.

      <h3> b. storyboards </h3>
      <p>
        I then began to create storyboards. Since Ali used a lot of imagery in his speech, I felt that it was appropriate to include lots of graphics with my kinetic typography. I knew at the time that it was an ambitious decision since implementing
        so many graphics would add much more work to an already time-consuming project. However, it was a challenge I was willing to face so that I could do the iconic speech justice.

      <h3> c. graphics </h3>
      <p>
        With this storyboard as reference, I began creating the graphics in Adobe Illustrator and splitting the layers in Photoshop. This way they could be directly imported into After Effects where I would animate them alongside the text.

      <h3> d. animating </h3>
      <p>
        My biggest challenges were getting the timing right and making the motion less robotic. I addressed the first problem by slowing down the preview frame by frame so that I could line everything up with the audio better. As for making the movement more natural, I ended up doing this by using motion blur and adding ease-in and ease-out effects to each movement.

      <p>
        This project was quite a challenge as it was my first time taking a design course and working with Photoshop, Illustrator, and After Effects. However, it allowed me to develop a strong foundation for these programs which helped me in my
        future design courses. This project also gave me a lot of confidence knowing that I was able to step out of my comfort zone and create something worth showcasing.
