      <h3> objective </h3>
      <p>
        Project for an Introduction to Technological Systems class. Students were given a three-week timeframe to create an interactive system which consisted of a digital environment with physical circuit controls.
      </p>

      <h3> programs & hardware used </h3>
      <p>
        Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, Processing, Arduino & circuitry.

      <h3> a. interaction model </h3>
      <p>
        Our project is an interactive simulation of a person’s room at different points in time. We wanted it to serve not only as a simulation, but also as a calming environment for users to interact with and leave running in the background as they go about doing other tasks. The digital environment (room) changes accordingly based on times that a user sets using a physical clock. This interaction model explains the main operation of our project. I made the vectors (except for the displayed times and music notes) and my partner created the background, explanations, and put it all together.

      <h3> b. room states </h3>
      <p>
        For the room states, my role was to create the base room and some of the items within it. This includes the room itself, the blinds, stone wall, toys, trophy, bed, paper crumples, the cup noodles, and the lighting effects for the night states. In total we created 23 room states, with every other one having unique lighting effects and items moved around the room. There are also four main room categories: sunrise/morning, afternoon, sunset, and night time. We made these using Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop.

      <h3> c. schematic </h3>
      <p>
        Using Figma, I was responsible for creating the schematic for our physical clock. The clock consists of a 32 x 8 LED dot matrix, a potentiometer (a variable resistor whose resistance changes when a knob is turned) to control the time being displayed on the dot matrix, a push button to confirm the time and send the data to the Processing application, and a piezo buzzer which plays a short melody whenever the push button is pressed.

      <h3> d. physical model </h3>
      <p>
        I was responsibel for making our physical clock, and ended up making a cardboard housing to enclose all the electronic components described earlier. To allow for easy adjustments and to make things as modular as possible, I made a hinge for the back of the housing. This made it easy to make adjustments to the components along the way. I also made a spacer to make the solderless breadboard and Arduino board stay firmly in place without being permanently fixed.

      <h3> d. programming & outcome </h3>
      <p>
        My partner and I worked together on coding the electronic components' functionality in Arduino. We took base code from an online tutorial on how to make a digital clock using an LED dot matrix, and made some changes to make the time change based on the turning of a potentiometer (a variable resistor whose resistance changes based on knob inputs). We also added a short melody to play once a time was inputted.
      </p>

      <p>
        I was then responsible for making the room states, background, and music change using Processing. I did this by making Processing receive the inputs from Arduino so that it can adjust the content accordingly using a series of cases for each possible state. I also wrote a short snippet of code to make the room slowly move up and down softly.

      <p>
        This project was a challenging but fun opportunity for me to learn how to incorporate a number of the skills that I've learned in SFU's Interactive Arts & Technology program: coding, digital design, and physical design. I think my partner and I were able to use these skills to successfuly create a soothing atmosphere with our graphics, animations, and calm lofi music. In the end, working on this project helped me develop these skills to the point where I can play around with Arduino and Processing and create my own projects in my own time for fun!

      <!-- Due to time constraints, the only changes that currently exist between each room state are the lightrays, filters, the time displayed on the clock within the room, and the placement of some of the items. If given more time, we would've wanted to include a person in the room doing different things during different times of the day, and also more animation for the daytime such as cloudes moving by.

      In the end, working on this project allowed me to properly understand how to send information between Processing and Arduino. The concept made sense during the lectures and labs, but it wasn’t until I actually applied them to my own work that I properly understood them. This knowledge gives me the foundation for me to play around with Arduino and Processing in the future and create my own projects in my own time for fun. -->
